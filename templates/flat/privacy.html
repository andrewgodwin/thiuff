    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>Your privacy is important to us, and there's a few basic rules we follow:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. It's your choice how anonymous you wish to be,
            though we may need personal information for some features or if we think you're a potential spammer.
        </li>
        <li>
            We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop the site, or protect our rights.
        </li>
        <li>
            We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please <a href="/contact/">contact us</a>.</p>

    <p>Thiuff is a trading name of, and run by, Coding Ponies Ltd., UK registered company 07234924. It is Thiuff's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating this site.</p>

    <h2>Website Visitors</h2>
    <p>
    Like most website operators, Thiuff collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Thiuff’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Thiuff’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Thiuff may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
    </p>

    <p>
    Thiuff also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on WordPress.com blogs. Thiuff only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that blog commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog where the comment was left.
    </p>

    <h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
    <p>
    Certain visitors to Thiuff’s websites choose to interact with Thiuff in ways that require Thiuff to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Thiuff gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a blog at WordPress.com to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Thiuff – by purchasing access to the Akismet comment spam prevention service, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Thiuff collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Thiuff. Thiuff does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
    </p>

    <h2>Aggregated Statistics</h2>
    <p>
    Thiuff may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Thiuff may monitor the most popular blogs on the WordPress.com site or use spam screened by the Akismet service to help identify spam. Thiuff may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Thiuff does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
    </p>

    <h2>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
    <p>
    Thiuff discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Thiuff’s behalf or to provide services available through Thiuff’s website, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Thiuff, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Thiuff will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Thiuff discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Thiuff believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Thiuff, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user and have supplied your email address, Thiuff may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, and if you request certain site features (such as password resets). If you send us a request (for example via a support email), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Thiuff takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
    </p>

    <h2>Cookies</h2>
    <p>
    A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Thiuff uses cookies to help Thiuff identify and track visitors, their usage of the Thiuff website, and their website access preferences. Thiuff visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Thiuff, with the drawback that certain features of Thiuff may not function properly without the aid of cookies.
    </p>

    <h2>Business Transfers</h2>
    <p>
    If Thiuff, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Thiuff goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Thiuff may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.
    </p>

    <h2>Content</h2>
    <p>
    Threads, discussions, replies and other user-created content you submit to Thiuff will be stored and displayed indefinitely
    unless you delete it. Even once deleted from public view, it may be retained in anti-spam systems or audit logs, but these
    are only accessible to Thiuff employees and subcontractors.
    </p>

    <h2>Privacy Policy Changes</h2>
    <p>
    Although most changes are likely to be minor, Thiuff may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Thiuff’s sole discretion. Thiuff encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
